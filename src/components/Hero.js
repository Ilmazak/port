              Hello, I am Ilma Jakariy, an aspiring chemist and a passionate
              undergraduate currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science degree in
              Applied Science. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed
              a strong foundation in chemistry, with a keen interest in both
              theoretical concepts and practical laboratory work. My studies
              have equipped me with essential skills in chemical analysis,
              laboratory safety, research methodologies, and scientific
              reporting. I am particularly interested in exploring areas such as
              organic chemistry, analytical techniques, and environmental
              science. My goal is to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world
              challenges, contributing to scientific innovation and the
              betterment of society. I am committed to continuous learning,
              professional growth, and staying updated with the latest
              advancements in the field of chemistry. With a passion for
              discovery and a drive for excellence, I am excited to embark on
              opportunities that will shape me into a skilled and responsible
              chemist. Thank you for visiting â€” welcome to my portfolio!
